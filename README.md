C-Launcher-API
==============

#Overview

This library allows programatic access to some USB foam dart launchers. The library itself currently only supports one type of launcher. However it is designed to allow easy addition of additional types of launchers. If your type isn't supported, feel free to add the code in and submit a pull request!


#Compiling

##Supported Systems

* Linux
* OSX - Experimental
* Windows - Experimental

##Requirementes

This library depends on pthreads and libusbx. Thus if you are compiling on windows, you'll need cygwin or simmilar to compile.

##Instructions

On Linux it should be as easy as just running make and make install.

Work on OSX and Windows is ongoing.

#Examples

I'm working on a few basic examples.
